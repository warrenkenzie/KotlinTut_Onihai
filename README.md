# Kotlin Project
This kotlin project is a personal project that I did without following a tutorial, where I developed a 
game where based on a prompt the user has to choose the correct answer by clicking 1 of 2 images provided,
where 1 image is correct and 1 image is wrong, the players has to answer based on a timer at the center of 
the screen.
